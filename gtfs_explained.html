        <h3>GTFS Explained</h3>
        <p>The General Transit Feed Specification is the de-factor standard format for sharing public transportation
            schedudling information. GTFS feeds are critical for the reliable and accurate implementation of services
            like Google Transit, the service for which the specification was created for initially in 2006. However, the
            format has evolved to become the backgone of sharing schedling info not only with app developers but also
            for the sharing of scheduling data between technology systems within transit authorities themselves (i.e.
            between CAD-AVL systems and digital headsigns. </p>
        <h4>Tranisit Stops are the Foundation</h4>
        <p>Transit stops are the foundation of the feed. They are where passengers interface with the transportation network.  Unlike the network for private automobiles which can be accessed anywhere, anytime by anyone, transit users are burdened by the need to arrive at a pre-definied stop at a specific time to catch a ride.  In the GTFS feed, everything revolves around transit stop location.</p>
