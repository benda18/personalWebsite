        <h3>Under Construction</h3>
        <h3>GTFS Explained</h3>
        <p>The General Transit Feed Specification is the de-factor standard format for sharing public transportation
            schedudling information. GTFS feeds are critical for the reliable and accurate implementation of services
            like Google Transit, the service for which the specification was created for initially in 2006. However, the
            format has evolved to become the backgone of sharing schedling info not only with app developers but also
            for the sharing of scheduling data between technology systems within transit authorities themselves (i.e.
            between CAD-AVL systems and digital headsigns.<br><br></p>

            </div>Transit vehicle location both sptially and temporally are the basis of the feed. <a
                href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference#stopstxt">stop_times.txt</a> holds this base
            data.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

            <div class="gtfs">
                <h4>Transit Stops are the Foundation of the Feed</h4>
                <img src="gtfs_stops.png" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0">
            </div>

            Transit stops are the foundation of the feed. They are where passengers interface with the transportation
            network. Stop info is stored and accessed from <a
                href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference#stopstxt">stops.txt</a>.
            Unlike the network for private automobiles which can be accessed anywhere, anytime by anyone,
            transit users are burdened by the need to arrive at a pre-definied stop at a specific time to catch a
            ride. In the GTFS feed, everything revolves around transit stop location.<br><br>
        </p>
        <div class="gtfs">
            <h4>Stop-Level Arrival Times</h4>
            <img src="gtfs_stoptimes.gif" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0" , height=125>
        </div>
        <p>Knowing the transit stop locations alone isn't enough info for most transit riders because most services run
            on an infrequent and/or a dynamic schedule based on the time-of-day and day-of-week. Therefore, the feed
            needs to convey when every transit vehicle will arrive at any particular stop location. This information is
            found in
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference#stop_timestxt">stop_times.txt</a>.
            Stop_times.txt is the largest file in most feeds because it represents the geo-temporal location of every
            vehcile at every point in time throughout an entire transit week. When you join stop_times.txt with
            stops.txt you can show how vehicles travel throughout a transit day, but you're still missing lots of
            information: what routes visit which stops, how Monday service differs from Sunday service, transfer
            locations, and much more.<br><br></p>
        <div class="gtfs">
            <h4>Route information</h4>
            <a href="gtfs_routes.png"><img src="gtfs_routes.png" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0" , height=125></a>
        </div>
        <p>The next level of information that gets integrated into the feed is information about individual routes.
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference#routestxt">Routes.txt</a> assigns a specific
            route name with each trip. </p><br><br><br><br>
            <div class="gtfs">
                <h4>Calendar Information</h4>
                <a href="gtfs_calendar_large.png"><img src="gtfs_calendar_small.png" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0" , height=125></a>
            </div>
        <p>So far, we've deconstructed the feed based on time-of-day. The next step is to break out feed data based on
            the day of week because service patterns vary typically on weekdays, weekends and holidays. Data
            is stored in <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference#calendartxt">calendar.txt</a></p>
