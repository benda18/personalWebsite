    Tim is a world-class transit planner who has worked for small- and mid-sized transtit agencies throughout the
      midwest and southeast since 2007. As a transit planner, Tim has ensured that policy decisions are
      made by an informed decision-making process, backed by supporting data and supported by adopted policy or planning
      documents. </p>
    <p>Tim was part of the multi-jurisdictional Wake County Tranist Plan planners who, with the support of Jarrett
      Walker Associates <a href="http://www.humantransit.org">(link)</a> developed a 10-year vision for transit investment in
      Raleigh and Wake County, North Carolina. The Plan was submitted to the public for their considration in the Summer
      of 2016 and the public then approved a 1/2 cent sales tax referrendum in the fall of 2016 election to implement
      the plan. The plan will more than double existing bus service in Wake County, construct four Bus Rapid Transit
      corridors in the City of Raleigh and Town of Cary, and begin the development of regional commuter rail connecting
      Wake County to Durham and Johnston Counties.</p>
    <p>Tim has a Bachelor of Urban Planning degree from the University of Cincinnati and lives in Durham, NC with his wife Abby, their two children Arlo and Esme, and pound dog Calabasa Broomsticks
      (or Cala for short). When not daydreaming about the future, Tim can be found with his family at the climbing gym
      where he's busy mantling a slice of Miguel's pizza or at home ironing his fitted sheets.</p>
